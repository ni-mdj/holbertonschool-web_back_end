# ES6 Data Manipulation

## Project Information
- **Project name:** ES6 data manipulation  
- **Level:** Amateur  
- **By:** Johann Kerbrat, Engineering Manager at Uber Works  
- **Weight:** 1  
- **Status:** Your score will be updated as you progress  

---

## Description
This project introduces you to ES6 data manipulation in JavaScript.  
You will practice working with:
- Arrays (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Typed Arrays
- `Set`, `Map`, `WeakMap`, and `WeakSet` data structures  

The goal is to understand how to efficiently manipulate collections of data and use the appropriate ES6 features.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without Google):
- How to use **map, filter, and reduce** on arrays  
- What are **Typed Arrays** and how to use them  
- How to use **Set**, **Map**, and **Weak data structures** (`WeakMap`, `WeakSet`)
