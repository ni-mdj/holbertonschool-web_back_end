# NoSQL - MongoDB Project

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum (Foundations - Part 3).  
It introduces the basics of **NoSQL databases** using **MongoDB**, both from the shell and via Python (`pymongo`).

## üìö Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what **NoSQL** means and how it differs from **SQL**
- Know the characteristics of **document-based storage**
- Use the **mongo shell** to interact with a MongoDB server
- Perform CRUD operations: insert, find, update, and delete documents
- Connect to MongoDB using **PyMongo**
- Write Python scripts to manipulate MongoDB collections
- Perform queries and filter data using different operators
- Analyze and display statistics from MongoDB logs
