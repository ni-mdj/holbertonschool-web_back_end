# Node.js Basics Project

A project to learn the fundamentals of Node.js, including file system operations, HTTP servers, Express.js, and advanced routing.

---

## Description

This project is part of the **Holberton School Web Back-End** curriculum.  
It is designed to provide a **hands-on introduction to Node.js** and its ecosystem.  

You will explore how Node.js works internally, learn how to build HTTP servers both with and without Express, and practice **file manipulation, asynchronous programming, and modern JavaScript (ES6/ESModules)**.

Key topics include:
- Running JavaScript with Node.js
- Using Node.js modules (`fs`, `process`, `http`)
- Creating HTTP servers (with and without Express)
- Reading CSV files synchronously/asynchronously
- Handling JSON and environment variables
- Advanced Express routing
- Error handling and middleware
- ES6 syntax with Babel
- Development tools like Nodemon
