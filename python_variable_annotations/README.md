# Python - Variable Annotations

## Description
This project explores type annotations in Python 3. You will learn how to use annotations to specify function signatures, variable types, and validate your code using `mypy`. The project also introduces the concept of **Duck Typing**.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand and use type annotations in Python 3.
- Annotate function signatures and variable types.
- Apply the concept of **Duck Typing**.
- Validate your code using `mypy`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9
- `pycodestyle` version 2.5.0 for code style validation.
- `mypy` for type annotation validation.
